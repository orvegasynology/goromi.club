<h1>Who is Goromi?</h1>
<p>a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>She's the drag persona of Goro Majima, a pretty eccentric creature, but very funny nonetheless.
    Her existence was to be a one-off joke, but the fans (me, myself, and tumblr) loved her a little too much. We got official merch of her. and an outfit in a game. yay....yay....</p>
    <p>Goromi.club's purpose is to serve as a shrine dedicated to our favorite hostess, Goromi, with a little bit of other LAD content on the side. It was established June 4th 2025, but conceptualized sometime in late May of that year. I have no plans to disassemble this website anytime soon!</p>
    <p>In the future, I want this to be a community project where Goromi fans from all around the world can share their creations  </p>
