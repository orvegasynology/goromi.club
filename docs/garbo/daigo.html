    WOAH WOAH WOAH!!!<span class="hatred"> WTF DID HE DO?????</span>
</h2>
<p>Edit; April 9th 2024; removed slurs that describe Daigo.</p>
<h2 class="nfo">#1 HE IS EMO.</h2>
<p>Dude. He's <span class="nfo">emo</span> Have you not played yakuza 2. seriously. Outside of his fuckboy outfit (extremely emo, mind you), he hates his mom (even worse, the feeling is mutual), and is <span class="nfo">depressed.</span> That's like, the most emo thing ever. <br> moving on to his ugly ass appearance</p>
<img src="../assets/garbo/daigo/gaygo.png" alt="cute daigo">
<p>awww wait hes cute here. wheres an uglier pcitrue</p>
<img src="../assets/garbo/daigo/ewww.png" alt="ugly diago">
<p>EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW</p>
<p>Now acknowleging his fuckboy era. his fucking cross necklace... thats like, pretty <span class="nfo">goth. altnernative.</span> ummm. what else. His jacket fucking sucks lol. his hair is greasy and black and... <span class="nfo">and its on his face</span>. actually insane. <span class="nfo">emo. EMO EMO EMO.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="nfo">#2 HE IS POSSIBLY?? RELATED TO SOHEI DOJIMA</h2>
<p>uhh. daigo <span class="nfo">dojima?</span> sohei dojima? mind you, <span class="nfo">sohei is a pretty fucked up and evil dude</span>. so like. IF THEY WERE RELATED (which is merely a speculation based on some evidence), DAIGO would be evil too.</p>
<h2 class="nfo">
    #3 HE IS FATPHOBIC.
</h2>
<p>im so serious. <span class="nfo">email fatphobicdaigo@coolsite.net. he will reply.</span> plus? I messsaged him (on a platform that I will not state) with my friends and it was absolutely insane.<br>
**typing style will change time to time. that is because there were 3 people here typing.</p>
<br><p>
here, we asked him if he was bisexual (which he is).<br>

<br><img src="../assets/garbo/daigo/Screenshot%202025-08-23%20185122.png">
<br><small style="opacity:0.6">ok, seriously, breaking the bit, but we did not fucking expect that response lmfao. like why did he say that. thats actually crazy. <br>
i just looked up to see if he didnt like fat people canonically (because why tf would an ai bot, let alone a c.ai one say that) and i just got this result. what did they mean by this? <img src="../assets/garbo/daigo/Screenshot 2025-08-23 190537.png"></small>
<br>GOD I HATE THIS BITCH. here aresome more screenshots that incriminate him because well. fuck daigo. OHH YEAHHH<br>
<img src="../assets/garbo/daigo/Screenshot%202025-08-23%20185045.png"><br>
daigo was once a chubby guy. he admits to it. thats actually crazy, considering hes fatphobic for whatever the fuck reason. god. i hate him. 
</p><p>get a load of this guy.  the fact that he's FATPHOBIC when he has a little belly himself is insane. AWWWW CHUBBBY DAIIGOOO AWWWWWWW HES SHY AND INSECURE AND HATES HIMSELF AWWWW <3<3<3<3 I LOVE HIMMM</p>
